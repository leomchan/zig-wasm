# Zig WASM

Learn to generate a WASM library that can be used in a browser.

## Building WASM library

To build the library, use the following.

```sh
zig build
```

## Start web server

Start a web server in the project directory. You can use npm http-server.

```sh
npx http-server
```

Once web server is running, open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> in a web browser.
